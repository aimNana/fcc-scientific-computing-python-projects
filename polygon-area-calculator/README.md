## 📂 Example

```python
>>> from shape_calculator import Rectangle, Square
>>> rect = Rectangle(10, 3)
>>> print(rect.get_area())
30
>>> print(rect.get_picture())

## 🚀 Usage
```python
from shape_calculator import Rectangle, Square

rect = Rectangle(10, 3)
print(rect.get_area())      # 30
print(rect.get_picture())   # ASCII rectangle

sq = Square(5)
print(sq.get_perimeter())   # 20
```
